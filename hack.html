      Overview
    </h2>
    <p>
      In this one-hour exercise, we'll apply our accessible notebook authoring tips to real-life Jupyter Notebooks. We'll be focusing on notebooks exported to HTML, a format that is partially accessible to screen reader users by default.

      Step One: Choose a Notebook
    </h2>

    <p>
      You have two options for picking a notebook to evaluate during this minihack:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use a notebook created by you or your organization. Since we'll be evaluating the HTML export of the notebook, you will first want to open the notebook in Jupyter, then Choose `File > Download as > HTML (.html)`. This will export your notebook to HTML in the same folder as the notebook. Once you're done, open the notebook in a web browser such as Chrome before going on to the next step.</li>
      <li>If you don't have your own notebook on hand, choose a notebook from one of the Space Telescope Science Institute projects below.
      </li>
    </ul>

	<div style="text-align:center" class="col-3 mx-auto">

	</div>
	<div class="col-9">
	  <p>
	    The jdat_notebooks repository contains notebooks illustrating workflows for post-pipeline analysis of JWST data. Some of the notebooks also illustrate generic analysis workflows that are applicable to data from other observatories as well. This repository and the notebooks are one component of STScI’s larger Data Analysis Tools Ecosystem.

	<div class="col-9">
	  <p>
	    Hello Universe is an initiative at MAST to provide a space for applying machine learning (ML) algorithms to astronomical data. The first set of notebooks are designed to span a range of ML techniques, and to highlight MAST mission data, including user-contributed high-level science products (HLSPs).

    <p>
      The HTML notebooks can be found using the links on the left side of each project page. Screen reader users can navigate by list or list item to jump right to the lists of notebooks.

      Step Two: Evaluate Notebook
    </h2>

    <p>
      Once you've chosen a notebook, choose some criteria from the notebook authoring tips document. Take a look at your chosen notebook and evaluate whether or not the notebook follows best practices for authoring notebooks in that area. You may wish to divide up some of the main areas of concern within your breakout group—for example, one group might evaluate headings while another looks at code formatting.

      Step Three: Review and Share
    </h2>    

    <p>
      When we regroup with the rest of the participants, we'll consider each groups answers to three questions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>What was the most common accessibility issue you encountered?</li>
      <li>What content immediately checked as accessible?</li>
      <li>What surprised you the most in this process?</li>
      <li>Do you think you’ll change anything when authoring notebooks or documents going forward?</li>
    </ul>

      Step ♾: Extra Credit / After the Hackathon
    </h2>
    <p>
      If you're feeling ambitious or looking for a more direct way to contribute your thoughts and results to STScI (or your organization), here are some ways to make a difference:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>If you're using an STScI notebook from JDAT, the HTML Jupyter Notebooks on the left side of the page are hosted in their own individual repositories on GitHub. You can find the repository in the table on the <a href="https://spacetelescope.github.io/hellouniverse/intro.html" target="_blank">JDAT project page</a> and either <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue">open an issue</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request">start a pull request</a>.</li>
      <li>If you're using an STScI notebook from Hello Universe, you can visit the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/spacetelescope/hellouniverse">repository containing all Hello Universe notebooks</a> and either <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue">open an issue</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request">start a pull request</a>.</li>
      <li>If you're not experienced with GitHub, you can also use Google or visit the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.stsci.edu/">STScI website</a> to find individuals or groups connected to your notebook and send them an email. Feel free to <a target="_blank" href="/#contact">reach out to the event organizers</a> for assistance.</li>
      </ul>
