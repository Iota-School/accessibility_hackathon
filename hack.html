      Overview
    </h2>
    <p>
      In this one-hour exercise, we'll apply our accessible notebook authoring tips to real-life Jupyter Notebooks. We'll be focusing on notebooks exported to HTML, a format that is partially accessible to screen reader users by default.
    </p>

      Step One: Choose a Notebook
    </h2>

    <p>
      You have three options for picking a notebook to evaluate during this minihack. (If you're not sure about this step, pick one of the default notebooks under the first option.)
    </p>

    <p>Option 1:  Choose one of the notebooks below. This is the default option.</p>

    <div style="margin-top:2em" class="container">
      <div class="row">
	<div style="text-align:center" class="col-4 col-md-3 mx-auto">
	  <a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg px-4 me-md-2" target="_blank" href="https://spacetelescope.github.io/jdat_notebooks/notebooks/asdf_example/asdf_example.html">ASDF Creation</a>

	</div>
	<div class="col-md-9 col-8">
	  <p>
JWST data files make use of the Advanced Scientific Data Format. This notebook shows how to create an ASDF (Advanced Scientific Data Format) file from a FITS file.<br><br>
	  </p>
	</div>
      </div>

      <div class="row">
	<div style="text-align:center" class="col-4 col-md-3 mx-auto">
	  <a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg px-4 me-md-2" target="_blank" href="https://spacetelescope.github.io/hellouniverse/notebooks/hello-universe/Classifying_JWST-HST_galaxy_mergers_with_CNNs/Classifying_JWST-HST_galaxy_mergers.html">Galaxy Mergers</a>
	</div>
	<div class="col-md-9 col-8">
	  <p>
An example of building, compiling, and training a convolutional neural network on simulated astronomical data. The CNN classifies JWST-HST galaxy mergers.<br><br>
	  </p>

	  
	</div>
      </div>    
    </div>

    <p>
      Option 2: Use a notebook created by you or your organization. Since we'll be evaluating the HTML export of the notebook, you will first want to open the notebook in Jupyter, then Choose `File > Download as > HTML (.html)`. This will export your notebook to HTML in the same folder as the notebook. Once you're done, open the notebook in a web browser such as Chrome before going on to the next step.
    </p>
    <p>
      Option 3: Select a different notebook from an STScI project. The HTML notebooks can be found using the links on the left side of each project page. Screen reader users can navigate by list or list item to jump right to the lists of notebooks.
    </p>
    
    <div style="margin-top:2em" class="container">

	<div class="col-md-9 col-8">
	  <p>
	    The jdat_notebooks repository contains notebooks illustrating workflows for post-pipeline analysis of JWST data. Some of the notebooks also illustrate generic analysis workflows that are applicable to data from other observatories as well. This repository and the notebooks are one component of STScI’s larger Data Analysis Tools Ecosystem.

	    Hello Universe is an initiative at MAST to provide a space for applying machine learning (ML) algorithms to astronomical data. The first set of notebooks are designed to span a range of ML techniques, and to highlight MAST mission data, including user-contributed high-level science products (HLSPs).

      Step Two: Evaluate Notebook
    </h2>

    <p>
      Once you've chosen a notebook:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Choose some criteria from the notebook authoring tips document. For example: focus on the notebook’s plots. Pick whichever area is most interesting to you. </li>
      <li>Take a look at your chosen notebook and evaluate whether or not the notebook follows best practices for authoring notebooks in that area. </li>
      <li>You may wish to divide up some of the main areas of concern within your breakout group—for example, one group might evaluate headings while another looks at code formatting.</li>
      </ul>

    <h2 class="display-6 lh-1 mb-3">
      Step Three: Review and Share
    </h2>    

    <p>
      When we regroup with the rest of the participants, we'll consider each groups answers to these questions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>What was the most common accessibility issue you encountered?</li>
      <li>What content was already accessible?</li>
      <li>What surprised you the most in this process?</li>
      <li>Do you think you’ll change anything when authoring notebooks or documents going forward?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Before returning to the main Zoom room, please choose a member of your breakout room who would be comfortable presenting the results of your discussion.
    </p>

      Step ♾: Extra Credit / After the Hackathon
    </h2>
    <p>
      If you're feeling ambitious or looking for a more direct way to contribute your thoughts and results to STScI (or your organization), here are some ways to make a difference:

    <ul>
      <li>
	If you have just audited a JDAT notebook, the HTML Jupyter Notebooks on the left side of the page are hosted in their own individual repositories on GitHub. You can find the repository in the table on the <a href="https://spacetelescope.github.io/hellouniverse/intro.html" target="_blank">JDAT project page</a> and either <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue">open an issue</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request">start a pull request</a>.</li>
      <li>
	If you audited a Hello Universe Notebook, you can visit the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/spacetelescope/hellouniverse">repository containing all Hello Universe notebooks</a> and either <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue">open an issue</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request">start a pull request</a>.</li>
      <li>If you're not experienced with GitHub, you can also use Google or visit the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.stsci.edu/">STScI website</a> to find individuals or groups connected to your notebook and send them an email. Feel free to <a target="_blank" href="index#contact">reach out to the event organizers</a> for assistance.</li>
